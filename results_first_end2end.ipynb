       "comment_text               The Constitution gives people the right to be left alone.  The state and the voters thereof have no interest in many issues.  Moral scorn is not a democratic right, whether it is sodomy, birth control, gay marriage or abortion.  If you want to make abortion a more public question, do what it takes to defeat the reasoning of Chapter IX of Roe, have Congress recognize fetal personhood at an earlier stage than viability.  If the President proposes such a law, support him for that, not because he may give you one pro-life justice out of three appointed (the current batting average for GOP Presidents).  You have the Presidency and the Congress - pass the law or at least make the Democrats filibuster it, although the likely result is compromise and the end of the public perception that the pro-life movement is necessary.  Until you take that bold step, your movement is still a fraud.   \n",

       "comment_text               Yes, and considering how many women and Millennial voters supported Trudeau in 2015, a CPC challenger needs to have at least some empathy to capture some of those votes from Trudeau.\\n\\nIn terms of policy (that's being generous to O'Leary because so far it's all talk), he is not really differentiated from a few other candidates like Lisa Raitt who would also scrap the carbon tax,  and eliminate the deficit, and shift to more decentralized government.  Unlikely O'Leary, she and other candidates have dedicated themselves to this campaign and appear to have actually costed and vetted their platforms.\\n\\nO'Leary is banking on celebrity status and the loudest voice to win, and could well surprise with that approach, but for the 2019 general election I think it's a big risk for the CPC.   \n",
